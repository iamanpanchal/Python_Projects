# 🎲 Dice Rolling Simulator — Python CLI Project

A simple Python command-line project that simulates rolling two dice.
Each time the user chooses to roll, the program generates two random numbers between **1 and 6**, just like real dice.

This is a beginner-friendly project for practicing loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

## 🎮 Project Description

* Simulates rolling **two dice**
* User chooses whether to roll or stop
* Generates random dice values each time
* Runs continuously until the user exits
* Handles invalid input safely

---

## 🚀 Features

* Random dice roll using Python `random` module
* Infinite loop controlled by user input
* Two-dice output as a tuple
* Simple and clean CLI interaction
* Input validation (`y/n`)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* `random.randint()`
* While loop
* If–elif–else conditions
* User input handling
* Loop control using `break`
* String methods (`lower()`)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Save the file as:

```
dice_simulator.py
```

3. Run in terminal:

```
python dice_simulator.py
```

---

## 🎯 How to Use

* Type `y` → roll the dice
* Type `n` → exit the game
* Any other input → shows error message

---

## 💻 Example Output

```
Roll dice? (y/n): y
(3, 6)

Roll dice? (y/n): y
(1, 2)

Roll dice? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing!
```
