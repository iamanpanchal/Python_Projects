# 🔐 Python Password Generator (Beginner CLI Project)

A simple command-line Password Generator built with Python.
This project creates a random password using letters, numbers, and symbols based on the length provided by the user. 
It also includes input validation to prevent invalid entries.

Perfect beginner project for practicing loops, conditionals, and randomness — and a great starter GitHub portfolio project.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔢 User chooses password length
* 🎲 Random password generation
* 🔤 Includes letters (A–Z, a–z)
* 🔢 Includes numbers (0–9)
* 🔣 Includes symbols (!@#$%^&*)
* ⚠️ Input validation (handles non-numeric input)
* 🔁 Retry loop for invalid length
* 🧾 Clean CLI output design

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python 3
* `random` module
* `string` module (imported)
* while loop + for loop
* exception handling (`try/except`)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Save the file as `random_password.py`
3. Run in terminal / command prompt:
